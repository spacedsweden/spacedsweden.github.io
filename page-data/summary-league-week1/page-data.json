Because of\r\nstaggered start with C starting the datapoints are not targeted at C teams just\r\nthe fact that C starts first and that has impact on A and B start.</p>\n<p>As organizers use Scoreholio to help us guess how long a division takes to\r\nfinish and I wanted to share this with you so you can know what to expect each\r\nweek (hopefully)</p>\n<p>C Division 12 teams 6 courts: 1:00h</p>\n<p>B Division 21 teams 4 courts: 2:06h</p>\n<p>A Division 12 teams 3 courts: 2:00h</p>\n<p>The above numbers assume 15 minute game time, and that players are ready at the\r\ncourt when the previous game is done.</p>\n<p>The goal of the league is still to offer players of all skills to enjoy the game\r\nof cornhole and chill with friends on a Thursday night. We love you all and we\r\nof course want you to hang out and enjoy the night with your friends, but to\r\ngive you an example if B would get an average time of 20 minutes between games\r\ninstead of 15, it adds almost hour to the tournament. So do check your phones,\r\nlook at coming up and get ready to play when scores are about 15 on the ongoing\r\ngames it saves a lot of time.</p>\n<p>Having said that we wanted to understand why we had these delays, in particular\r\nbecause we wanted to understand if the change with ScoreMagic was the culprit\r\nand make changes accordingly. Looking at the game logs for each division and C\r\nin particular that took 1:40 to complete over the expected 1 hour finish time</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Late start (+15-20 min):</strong> We did not manage to start the C league until\r\naround 6:20 due to waiting for teams and also week 1 is always more stuff to\r\nprepare with payment, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven and low number of teams in C (15 min):</strong> Due to an uneven number of\r\nteams in C, the last two games could not start without waiting for the 3rd\r\nfrom last game to finish (as that's just how round robin works).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Low numbers of teams 2 (7 min):</strong> Because there were only 9 teams showing\r\nup for C, which is the absolute worst number to have for a 4 round RR, we\r\ncould not use all courts, only 4 courts could be used because we did not\r\nhave enough teams to fill 5. It may seem odd but removing two courts and\r\nlosing the capabilities to run 2 additional games at the same time have an\r\nimpact on total time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Competitive games on one court (5 min) :</strong> Not only did we have a above\r\npoint delay the game play, we also had over average many round games, since\r\nthe number of match ups in a 4 round robin formats require 8 teams and we\r\nhad 9, those long games help up 2 teams of the 8 to be matched up with teams\r\nwaiting that also already played each other escalating the time in overall.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Game time longer than expected (2 min):</strong> In general, in all divisions\r\ngame time on average was a little bit longer than expected, 2-4 minutes, we\r\nknow that was some of was a learning curve for a few teams with scoremagic.\r\nBut this point is also affected by point 2 and 3 because we only know the\r\ntime between you submit the final score on each court. But in C we did have\r\nan average amount of games over 20 rounds as well, this also adds time and\r\ntrickles down the following games.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Slow tech</strong> <strong>(1 min)</strong>: as you probably noticed yourself, it was tough to\r\nload stats even on your phone and some tablets were slow. Hard to know why\r\nthat was. Most likely a combination of our MIFI being a bit slow and\r\nScoreholio.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Looking at the above as you can see there are a lot of moving parts, and as\r\norganizers we can only change a few. Our goal is to provide a fun cornhole night\r\nfor everyone and in order better the chances for that we will make a few changes\r\nto minimize the two biggest time thieves.</p>\n<p>The reasons for delays that we as organizers can change are <strong>35 mins (point\r\n1,2)</strong>. we can don’t want to add round limits to a good cornhole game so\r\ncompetitive games are not changeable.</p>\n<h2>What we as organizers will do</h2>\n<p><strong>Start on time -15 min:</strong> Welcome talk will be at 5:55 for a maximum of 5\r\nminutes. Bags will fly at 6</p>\n<p>If you and your team have not checked in at 6PM, you will be moved to finished\r\nnot in play. If you show up before round 2 is concluded, we will allow you to\r\nplay. If round 3 has started, we cannot let you play.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are not checked in by 6:00 PM for C you will be moved to not in play.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you are not checked in by 7:30 PM for A and B you will be moved to not in\r\nplay.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Uneven and low number of teams –15-22 min:</strong> Up until now when we had the\r\nunlucky number where the last team have to wait and potentially also another\r\nteam have to play one extra game to give the odd team 4 games. We will not do\r\nthat anymore (for any division). If 9 teams show up for a 4 round robin one team\r\nwill end up playing only 3 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Change start time for A and B 7:30:</strong></p>\n<p>Looking back at previous weeks we kind of never started at the right time here.\r\nSo to avoid to frustrate the few that get annoyed by us not keeping time and to\r\nrespect the time of others so you know bags will now fly 7:30 same rules apply\r\nfor A and B as for C.</p>\n<h2>What we as organizers could do if above does not help and we keep being this delayed</h2>\n<p><strong>Make scoremagic optional:</strong> While we use this to track who qualified for\r\nplayoffs if a majority of you as players feel that it’s a lot of pain to use\r\nthis or we see that game times keep getting longer we will make it optional or\r\nremove it. However we expect this to have medium impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Introduce game timers again:</strong> Many of you don’t know but way back we had game\r\ntimers set to 15 minutes, the team with highest score after 15 minutes win.</p>\n<p><strong>Split days:</strong> We could split days but we really don’t want to do that. As\r\norganizers it would impact our lives a lot because we need to dedicate two\r\nnights per of running cornhole for you. All of us do this on a voluntary basis\r\nbecause we enjoy it so it would be hard. Also, we believe that would seriously\r\nhave an impact on the great group feeling and club spirit we have.</p>\n<h2>What you do as team/player can do to keep things rolling (everybody)</h2>\n<p><strong>If you are on time you are late,</strong> if possible come 15-20 minutes early we\r\nknow this can be particularly challenging for C division that travels from work.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are late but are coming:</strong> If you are on your way, with the new\r\ncheck-in ability on Scoreholio do check in if you know you are 10 -15 late. If\r\nyou know that there are not enough players on your team there already <strong>do</strong>\r\nsend a message to one of us and we will make sure you are not first up and we\r\nwill put you back in play when you arrive.</p>\n<p><strong>If you know you are not coming:</strong> Please let us know, it will keep the stress\r\nlevel for us down knowing that you won’t show up.</p>\n<p><strong>Be ready when you are almost up:</strong> Keep an eye on the game queue in\r\nScoreholio, if your team is in position 1-4 you are likely to be up on the next\r\ncourt with the highest score. Get your bags, find your teammate and why not even\r\ngo and watch and cheer on the court where you suspect you will be up.</p>\n<h2>Reminder for week 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Make sure you have notifications turned on for Scoreholio</strong>, you will get a\r\ncheck in notification on your phone click it and check in if you are playing\r\nthat night. Expect these notifications to start about 30 min before bags fly. If\r\nyou know how to turn that on, ask someone on the board and we will help you\r\nconfigure it.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>[Your Name]</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Summary of week 1 late start","date":"January 28, 2022","description":null}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"5894c55d-f7cb-5faf-b53d-a04ab9ce62c3","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
