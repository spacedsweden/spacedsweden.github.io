and B last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general week 1 quite often suffers from delays, this week 1 league start was
exceptionally late start for A and B compared to past leagues. Because of
staggered start with C starting the data points are not targeted at C teams just
the fact that C starts first and that has impact on A and B start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As organizers use Scoreholio to help us guess how long a division takes to
finish and I wanted to share this with you so you can know what to expect each
week (hopefully)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C Division 12 teams 6 courts: 1:00h, actual average time 19:44min/between games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B Division 21 teams 4 courts: 2:06h actual average time 16:38min/between games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Division 12 teams 3 courts: 2:00h actual average time 18:34min/between games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above estimation numbers assume 15 minute game time, and that players are ready at the court when the previous game is done. As you see all division where slightly slower and C average time between games resulted in an estimated 20 min delay.
Both A and b also ended later than expected but since nobody was waiting to use the courts its only we as organizers and the bar staff that sufferers from that:D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the league is still to offer players of all skills to enjoy the game
of cornhole and chill with friends on a Thursday night. We love you all and we
of course want you to hang out and enjoy the night with your friends, but to
give you an example if B would get an average time of 20 minutes between games
instead of 15, it adds almost hour to the tournament. So do check your phones,
look at coming up and get ready to play when scores are about 15 on the ongoing
games it saves a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that we wanted to understand why we had these delays, in particular
because we wanted to understand if the change with ScoreMagic was the culprit
and make changes accordingly. Looking at the game logs for each division and C
in particular that took 1:40 to complete over the expected 1 hour finish time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late start (+15-20 min):&lt;/strong&gt; We did not manage to start the C league until
around 6:20 due to waiting for teams and also week 1 is always more stuff to
prepare with payment, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too many courts and Competitive games in C (20-30):&lt;/strong&gt; In order to get things rolling we started with 5 courts and reduced it to 4 with 9 times, together with that we had one team that did 30 min games all night compared to the estimated 15 minute game time trickled down and escalated two delays:
a. Because that team plus the opponents where tied up for almost two rounds compared to the other teams the number of teams that could match up with them quickly reduced as some teams completed 4 games before they completed 2.
b. 4 courts basically became 3.5 courts since that court was tied up for 2 rounds on their 1 round.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the overview at 7PM, court 2 and 4 was done with round 3 (basically right on time). Court 1 adn 2 had started to lag because first long game on court 1. This started to create a bit or an early match up problem since you can no longer find matchup&apos;s on for court 4 that finished at 18:50. This then snowballed and the number of usable courts just went down because the software is trying to make sure you don&apos;t play the same team again the same night. And it has been the strategy/desire of the club historically to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it was not only court 1 that had very even matchups, also court 2 started up with a monster 22 round game, and to be honest those games are the most fun so we &lt;strong&gt;do not want&lt;/strong&gt; to remove this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We as organizers failed to spot this being busy with alot of other things releated to week 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game time longer than expected (2-4 min):&lt;/strong&gt; In general, in all divisions
game time on average was a little bit longer than expected, 2-4 minutes, we
know that was some of was a learning curve for a few teams with ScoreMagic.
But this point is also affected by point 2 and 3 because we only know the
time between you submit the final score on each court. But in C we did have
an average amount of games over 20 rounds as well, this also adds time and
trickles down the following games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow tech&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(1 min)&lt;/strong&gt;: as you probably noticed yourself, it was tough to
load stats even on your phone and some tablets were slow. Hard to know why
that was. Most likely a combination of our MIFI being a bit slow and
Scoreholio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the above as you can see there are a lot of moving parts, and as
organizers we can only change a few. Our goal is to provide a fun cornhole night
for everyone and in order better the chances for that we will make a few changes
to minimize the two biggest time thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for delays that we as organizers can change are &lt;strong&gt;35-45 mins (point
1,2)&lt;/strong&gt;. we don’t want to add round or time limits to a good cornhole game and it may just have been a fluke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we as organizers will do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the easiest non intrusive thing we will do is to to
&lt;strong&gt;Start on time -15 min:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome talk will be at 5:55 for a maximum of 5
minutes. Bags will fly at 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you and your team have not checked in at 6PM, you will be moved to finished
not in play. If you show up before round 2 is concluded, we will allow you to
play. If round 3 has started, we cannot let you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are not checked in by 6:00 PM for C you will be moved to not in play.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are not checked in by 7:30 PM for A and B you will be moved to not in
play.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simply have to stop being nice and wait for teams. It sucks but it affects to many other players to do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too many courts and Competitive games in C -20-30min:&lt;/strong&gt; After long discussions with Scoreholio, it simply not possible to guarantee that you would end up meeting the same team again it can happen, but scoreholio don&apos;t add that game to to a court automatically. As explained above both number of courts and game time can increase or reduce the risk for this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on we will make the following changes to reduce the risk of this happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We pay closer attention to courts and game time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the courts more aggressive:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the maximum number of courts (3-6 depending on many teams show up) to get round 1 going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduce the number of courts by 1 or 2 depending on how many teams show up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we get to a place where we have very competitive games again, we will force games among same teams again for the week. And try to make sure you don&apos;t meat those teams the next week to keep on time. We know it&apos;s not as fun, but compared to enforcing a game timer to limit game time per round we think that is the better solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add game timer but not enforce it, but we ask you to be aware by looking at the game timer. If you are over 15 min for game you are also highly likely to be up right away after this game so &lt;strong&gt;be prepared to stay in your court&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change start time for A and B 7:30:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at previous weeks we kind of never started at the right time here.
So to avoid to frustrate the few that get annoyed by us not keeping time and to
respect the time of others so you know bags will now fly 7:30 same rules apply
for A and B as for C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we as organizers could do if above does not help and we keep being this delayed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make ScoreMagic optional:&lt;/strong&gt; While we use this to track who qualified for
playoffs if a majority of you as players feel that it’s a lot of pain to use
this or we see that game times keep getting longer we will make it optional or
remove it. However we expect this to have medium impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduce game timers again:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of you don’t know but way back we had game
timers set to 15 minutes, the team with highest score after 15 minutes win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Split days:&lt;/strong&gt; We could split days but we really don’t want to do that. As
organizers it would impact our lives a lot because we need to dedicate two
nights per of running cornhole for you. All of us do this on a voluntary basis
because we enjoy it so it would be hard. Also, we believe that would seriously
have an impact on the great group feeling and club spirit we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you do as team/player can do to keep things rolling (everybody)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are on time you are late,&lt;/strong&gt; if possible come 15-20 minutes early we
know this can be particularly challenging for C division that travels from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are late but are coming:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are on your way, with the new
check-in ability on Scoreholio do check in if you know you are 10 -15 late. If
you know that there are not enough players on your team there already &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;
send a message to one of us and we will make sure you are not first up and we
will put you back in play when you arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you know you are not coming:&lt;/strong&gt; Please let us know, it will keep the stress
level for us down knowing that you won’t show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be ready when you are almost up:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep an eye on the game queue in
Scoreholio, if your team is in position 1-4 you are likely to be up on the next
court with the highest score. Get your bags, find your teammate and why not even
go and watch and cheer on the court where you suspect you will be up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reminder for week 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you have notifications turned on for Scoreholio&lt;/strong&gt;, you will get a
check in notification on your phone click it and check in if you are playing
that night. Expect these notifications to start about 30 min before bags fly. If
you know how to turn that on, ask someone on the board and we will help you
configure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
